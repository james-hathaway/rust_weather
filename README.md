To use: On the command line, enter 'cargo run' followed by a single space. after this, enter the latitude and longitude, separated only by a comma.
  Example: 'cargo run 40.4406,-79.9959' for Pittsburgh.
  
This simple command line application let me make use of recent Rust skills I have been developing. While building this project, I worked with structs which have proven to be quite useful as a tool for me. I improved on the use of {} to print dynamic variables in print lines, which is another cool feature. Lastly, I improved my use of functions for code organization and clairty. This was a fun project!
